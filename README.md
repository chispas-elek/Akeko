# Akeko
Akeko repository on GitHub

This is my final degree project and I want to do using GitHub because I like free software.

Akeko is a software that wants to be a good tool for student management. The idea is to register every student in
a bunch of different type of services like mysql, github, apache......

Thanks of this tool one professor can save more of his time and do something more productive.


In development.....
